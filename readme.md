# Othello Game Project

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for an Othello game, designed to be run both as a console application and with a GUI. The game utilizes the Observer and Strategy design patterns to maintain a clean separation of concerns and to facilitate easy updates or changes in game strategy and display types.

## Project Structure


- **main.py**: The entry point of the game. Initializes the game setup and starts the game loop.
- **game_config.py**: Contains the `GameConfig` class for managing game settings such as player colors and difficulty levels.
- **game.py**: Manages the game logic, including setting up the game, adding observers, and notifying them of updates.
- **board.py**: Defines the `Board` class, responsible for game state and logic like valid moves and disc placements.
- **player.py**: Defines the `Player` class. Players are initialized with a color and a strategy.
- **strategies/**: Contains different strategies for players.
  - **base_strategy.py**: Abstract base class for player strategies.
  - **human_strategy.py**: Strategy for human players, managing input collection.
  - **computer_strategy.py**: Strategy for computer players, here we can implement alphas-beta algorithm (args['parameter-name which should be passed'])
- **interfaces/**: Contains definitions for different user interfaces.
  - **console_display.py**: Handles console output for displaying the game state.
  - **gui_display.py**: Manages GUI display updates (requires additional GUI library integration).
- **helper.py**: Contains helper functions for input validation and conversion, all the functions is static to be used in any class.



## Design Patterns Used

### Observer Pattern
The `Game` class acts as a subject, notifying all attached observers (display types) of state changes in the game. This allows for easy updates and changes to the game's display without modifying the core game logic.

### Strategy Pattern
The `Player` class uses strategies defined under `strategies/` to decide moves. This allows changing the playing behavior of players dynamically during runtime, facilitating easy experimentation and testing of different AI algorithms or player interactions.
